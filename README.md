# SuperhotSilkSongMod

With this mod, **time moves with Hornet**.

The world slows down when she stands still and speeds up as she moves — just like in **SUPERHOT**.  
Start slow, build momentum by holding movement keys, and reach your chosen maximum speed.  
Releasing controls eases time back down to its calm state.

### Modes
- **Movement-based** – Game speed stays high while Hornet is moving  
- **Input-based** – Game speed increases when specific inputs are pressed  

### Controls
- **Keyboard:** Multiple key binding options  
- **Controller:** Fixed and analog support  

### Fine Tuning Options
- Minimum and maximum speed  
- Speed growth and decay rates
